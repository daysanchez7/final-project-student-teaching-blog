<h3>Description of Application Through the Lens of the User</h3>
<p1>The application Day’s Student-Teaching Blog will consist of multiple tabs. 
    When the website is first open, the user will see a brief background of Dayanna Sanchez. 
    Within the homepage, there are three tabs. The first tab will contain daily quotes given 
    by Day to motivate student-teachers during their student-teaching. The second tab contains 
    advice from Day on what to do and not to do during their student-teaching. The third tab 
    will be where other student-teachers can post any advice they want to give. Overall, Day’s 
    Student-Teaching Blog is a community of student-teachers that are going to encourage each other.
