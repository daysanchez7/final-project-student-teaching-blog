<h3>Description of Application Through the Lens of the User</h3>
<p1>The application Day’s Student-Teaching Blog will consist of multiple tabs. 
    When the website is first open, the user will see a brief background of Dayanna Sanchez. 
    Within the homepage, there are three tabs. 
    The first tab will be where student-teachers can rate how they're feeling for their student-teaching.
    Depending how they feel, they will recieve a quote.
    The second tab will contain additional quotes to motivate student-teachers during their 
    student-teaching. 
    The third tab contains advice from Day on what to do and not to do during their student-teaching.   
    Overall, Day’s 
    Student-Teaching Blog is a community of student-teachers that Day will be encouraging.
